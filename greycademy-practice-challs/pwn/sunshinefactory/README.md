On your first day at work at the sunshine factory, your supervisor lets you make a sunshine however you'd like! Remember, however, that there can only be one sun, and bad sunshines go punished...

Here are some hints:

1. Memory is allocated using calloc, which means that we're dealing with the heap instead of the stack. 

2. Once you've allocated some memory, use gdb to inspect the memory and see what your input could potentially overwrite! This will give you an idea of how you could exploit the program.

3. Instead of fully overwriting a pointer, have you considered just... partially overwriting it?
