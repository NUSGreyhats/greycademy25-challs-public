# Description

How fast can you type?!

# Solution

* Godly typing speed
* You can use the debugger to hook the user input and always make getch return the correct character.
    * Should be fun to teach them a bit of "game hacking" ideas
    * Solvable without decompilation if they know a bit of assembly / use cheat engine
